							<h2>Note to Termination of Contract of Employment</h2>
							<p>Either the employer or employee can terminate their continuous contract of employment by giving the other party the <strong>“due notice”&nbsp;in advance to its required length</strong> or <strong>“wages in lieu of notice”</strong> instead.</p>
							<p>If the the due notice is given to opposite&nbsp;party shorter than its required length, wages in lieu of notice is compulsory to be given as a form of compensation to the opposite party unless the termination happens within the first month of probation period.&nbsp;The length of due notice varies according to the employment condition.</p>
							<p>Nevertheless, both employer and employee bears <strong>the SAME liability</strong> related to the required length of&nbsp;due notice and paying wages in lieu of notice to the opposite party.</p>
							<p>Contract of employment can further express the terms related to the required length of due notice and wages in lieu of notice, EO offer their minimum requirement as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>When the employment condition is still within probation but after the first month of probation, not less than <strong>7 days notice</strong> is required to opposite&nbsp;party on termination (or referring to agreement but it must not less than 7 days)</li>
								<li>When the employment condition is after the probation period (or no probation period), not less than <strong>1 month notice</strong> is required to opposite&nbsp;party on termination (or referring to agreement but is must not less then 7 days).</li>
								<li>Wages in lieu of notice is calculated by multiplying the average daily (or monthly) full wages of earned by employee with the number of &nbsp;days (or month) in the length of notice.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Without Due Notice or Wages in lieu of notice</h3>
							<p>In some of the extreme and serious situations in below (other than employee within probation period), an employer may summarily dismiss an employee without giving the due notice as well as paying the wages in lieu of notice, an employee also may immediately terminate the contract without the notice at the same sense.</p>
							<p>However, the&nbsp;party who make decision of termination&nbsp;bears the responsibility to proof their actions in the question of laws. Given that the establishment of&nbsp;EO tends to protect employees,&nbsp;it is advised that employers&nbsp;should always communicate to employees and proceed the termination by giving required due notice or the wages in lieu of notice according to the contract or EO to avoid legal liability.&nbsp;Summary dismissal is a serious disciplinary action which should only be taken place when an employee has committed misconduct as below and the employer has been giving repeated warning.</p>
							<p>Employers may summarily dismiss employees under either circumstance as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>disobeys a lawful and reasonable order in a willful manner</li>
								<li>misconducts himself</li>
								<li>guilty of fraud or dishonesty</li>
								<li>habitually neglectful in his duties</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Note to Employers: Employer is prohibited from dismissal of employee without&nbsp;the notice as well as the wages in lieu of notice because an employee takes part in strike. Taking part in strike does not fulfill the legal ground stated above.</p>
							<p>Employee may immediately terminate employment contract under either circumstances:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>reasonably fear physical danger by violence or disease</li>
								<li>in danger by&nbsp;ill-treatment by employer</li>
								<li>being given medical certificate in supporting to employee’s unfit for works engaged AND&nbsp;being employed for not less than 5 years</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Paid for Termination Payments</h3>
							<p>In general, the employer should calculate and pay all the payment to employee on termination of employment, the items involved are usually as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>outstanding wages</li>
								<li>wages in lieu of notice (if any)</li>
								<li>payment of any untaken annual leave (pro rata payment for current&nbsp;leave year, if any)</li>
								<li>end of year payment (pro rata payment for current payment year, if any)</li>
								<li>long service payment or severance payment (if any)</li>
								<li>other payment written in employment contract e.g. gratuity, provident fund, etc.</li>
							</ul>
