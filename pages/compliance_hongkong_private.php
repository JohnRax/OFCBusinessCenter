								<h3>Internal Record: Annual Accounts</h3>
								<p>One (1) Profit and Loss Account (P&amp;L) and a balance sheet for the Limited Company must be audited by Hong Kong registered auditors (i.e. Certified Public Accountants) and be present to the shareholders in general meeting within 18 months after incorporation incorporation and then at least once in every calendar year. Limited companies are required to file their accounts with the Inland Revenue Department (IRD)</p>
								<h3>Internal Record:&nbsp;Directors’ report</h3>
								<p>A directors’ report must be prepared in conjunction with the annual accounts. The Companies Ordinance provides a list of what this report should contain and this list includes details of contracts with the company or certain companies with which it is associated which are significant in relation to the company’s business and in which any director has a material interest.</p>
								<h3>Internal Record:&nbsp;Annual general meeting (AGM)</h3>
								<p>According to the latest updates, all limited companies can dispense AGMs if and only if certain requirements are met for advanced companies’ flexibility plus cost saving, here are the criteria for giving up AGMs:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>With the utilization of written resolution (WR) for decision making and copies of related documents are provided to shareholders by the specific circulation date; OR</li>
									<li>The incorporated body is a single member company (i.e. the only director is also the only shareholder); OR</li>
									<li>A resolution about “no AGM is needed” is passed by all members of incorporation, given that such resolution is not revoked and none of the member has proposed for holding an AGM;</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Previously, at least one (1) annual general meeting of the shareholders must be held within 18 months after incorporation, and then at least once in every calendar year but not later than 15 months after the last annual general meeting. This 15 month period may be extended at the discretion of the Companies Registry. An annual general meeting must be held even though there may be no accounts available for presentation to the meeting and no other relevant business to attend to.</p>
								<p>To hold a AGM, the directors must approve the accounts and the directors’ report, they may recommend a dividend and must resolve to call the annual general meeting. If all the shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the annual general meeting so agree, the meeting may be held at short notice, but otherwise at least 21 clear days’ notice is required. Copies of any audited accounts to be considered at the annual general meeting must be sent to all shareholders, debenture holders and other persons so entitled not less than 21 days before the date of the meeting, unless all shareholders entitled to attend and vote at the meeting otherwise agree.</p>
								<h3>Internal Record:&nbsp;Holding of Members’ Particular &amp; Registered Address</h3>
								<p>Forms contained in each company kit make provision for all information required by the Ordinances. The original or copy of the Register of Members must be kept at the Registered Office in the Hong Kong.</p>
								<h3>Internal Record: Maintenance of Register of Transfers, Directors and Secretaries</h3>
								<p>A company is required by law to maintain these registers. They must be kept at the Registered Office of the Company.</p>
								<h3>Internal Record: Maintenance of Minutes and Financial Records</h3>
								<p>A company is required to keep minutes of all meetings of directors, members, committees of directors, committees of officers and committees of members. Copies of all written resolutions consented to by the foregoing parties must also be kept.</p>
								<h3>Companies Registry: Filing of Annual Return</h3>
								<p>An Annual Return must be filed with the Companies Registry at least once a year (except if there has been no change in the filed particulars since the date of the last annual return, in which case a certificate confirming this fact can be filed in lieu of an annual return).</p>
								<p>The annual return contains among other things:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>particulars of the authorized and issued share capital of the company</li>
									<li>the names and addresses of its directors and the secretary</li>
									<li>the names and addresses of its registered shareholders</li>
									<li>the amount secured by any registered charges.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The return must be signed by a director and the secretary of the company and must be filed within <strong>42 days of the anniversary</strong> of the incorporation of the company. Public companies and companies limited by guarantee without a share capital must file their annual return within 42 days of the annual general meeting in each year.</p>
								<h3>Companies Registry:&nbsp;Filings of Changes in Particulars</h3>
								<h4>Filing obligations</h4>
								<p>A company must file the relevant particulars with the Registrar within the period indicated, in the event of:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>any change in the directors or secretary or in the filed particulars of any existing directors or secretary – 14 days</li>
									<li>any change in the location of the registered office – 14 days</li>
									<li>any increase in the authorised share capital – 15 days</li>
									<li>any relocation of the company’s statutory books from the company’s registered office – 14 days</li>
									<li>the passing of a special resolution or certain other resolutions – 15 days</li>
									<li>any allotment or issue of new shares (this also requires the payment of a capital fee on the amount of any premium over the nominal value at which the shares are allotted or issued) – 8 weeks</li>
									<li>the creation of a charge over certain types of assets or the acquisition subject to an existing charge of certain types of assets, in either case whether the asset is within or outside Hong Kong – 5 weeks.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>In relation to the last two items, if the relevant particulars are not filed with the Registrar within the prescribed period, an application will have to be made to the Court for an extension of the time within which the particulars may be filed. Any such application will need to be supported by an affidavit giving an explanation as to why the particulars were not filed within the prescribed period.</p>
								<h4>Change of name</h4>
								<p>To effect a change in the name of a company (which includes the adoption or abandonment of a formal English or a Chinese version of the name):</p>
								<ul>
									<li>the shareholders must approve of the change in name by special resolution</li>
									<li>the new name must be registered with the Registrar.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>It normally takes about 14 working days from the time of the filing of the special resolution for the certificate of incorporation on change of name to be issued. The change in name is effective from the date on such certificate.</p>
								<h4>Increases in authorized and issued share capital</h4>
								<p>Any increase in the authorized share capital of a company requires the approval of the shareholders. A company’s Articles of Association typically provide for the increasing of the company’s authorized share capital by way of ordinary resolution. Any increase in authorized share capital will attract a capital fee and notice of the increase must also be filed with the Registrar together with a signed copy of the resolution.</p>
								<h4>Changes to Articles of Association</h4>
								<p>Most of the provisions of a company’s Articles of Association can be changed by special resolution .</p>
								<p>There are exceptions to this general rule. Where a company has issued different classes of shares, the special rights of any one class may, subject to the Articles of Association, be changed only with the approval of 75% of the holders of shares of that class. A member must agree in writing to an alteration to the Articles of Association which requires that member to take or subscribe for more shares or increase his liability to contribute to the share capital of the company or otherwise pay money to the company.</p>
								<p>A signed copy of every special resolution and every resolution varying a provision in the Articles of Association must be filed with the Registrar and annexed to every copy of the Articles of Association of the company issued subsequently to any such change. When the Articles&nbsp;of Association is amended it must be reprinted and filed with the Companies Registry.</p>

								<p>The issuing of new shares in a company is a <strong>three-stage process</strong> involving the following:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>The allotment by the directors of the shares to particular persons and the issuance of the shares to such persons after the entering into the company’s register of shareholders of the relevant particulars.</li>
									<li><strong>Allotments of shares.</strong> Other than allotments pursuant to offers to existing shareholders pro-rata to their existing holdings, may only be made with the prior approval of the shareholders in general meeting. This approval may be given either in relation to a particular allotment or allotments or generally. In either case this shareholder approval expires (if not previously revoked by the company in general meeting) when the next annual general meeting of the company is held or ought to be held.</li>
									<li><strong>A return of allotment of shares.</strong>&nbsp;Disclosing the members and their shareholdings must be filed with the CR&nbsp;<strong>within one month</strong> of the date of the allotment.

								<p>A share may be beneficially owned by someone other than the registered holder.

								<p>The transfer of legal title to shares in a Hong Kong company is effected by an “instrument of transfer”. Beneficial title to shares is transferred by way of contract notes (a bought note and a sold note).</p>
								<p>Contract notes must be submitted for stamping within two days (30 days if the sale takes place outside Hong Kong) of their execution. <strong>Ad valorem stamp duty</strong> is levied on each contract note (i.e. both the bought note and the sold note) at the rate of HK$1.00 per HK$1,000 or part thereof, of, whichever is the higher of the consideration paid or the value of the shares transferred (so that the total rate of duty on a sale of shares is effectively 0.2%) . Exemptions from stamp duty are available for intra-group transfers. We will be pleased to provide more detailed advice on the requirements for exemption on request.</p>
								<p>A copy of the latest audited accounts (consolidated where relevant) or latest management accounts (if audited accounts have not been prepared or if they are not up to date) together with details of any land and properties held and a copy of any sale and purchase agreement must normally be submitted when the documents are lodged for stamping. The Stamp Duty Office may also require additional information.</p>
								<p>The instrument of transfer attracts a HK$5 fixed duty. In the case of a sale and purchase of shares by a person who is not resident in Hong Kong, the ad valorem stamp duty can be paid on the instrument of transfer in additional to the HK$5 fixed duty if contract notes have not been made out and stamped.</p>
								<p>Where a transfer of the beneficial ownership is made otherwise than by sale and purchase e.g. by way of gift, the instrument of transfer is stampable at the fixed rate of HK$5 plus ad valorem stamp duty of 0.2% of the value of the shares at the date of transfer.</p>
								<p>When there is a sale of beneficial ownership only and no transfer of legal ownership (i.e., where the shares will remain registered in the name of the same person as a nominee for the beneficial owner), contract notes must be made out and ad valorem stamp duty of 0.2% paid. An instrument of transfer will not be required in this case but it is advisable for there to be a declaration of trust (see below).</p>
								<p>Ad valorem stamp duty is not payable on a transfer in registered ownership which does not involve any change in the beneficial ownership of the shares. Where shares are registered in the name of a nominee, it is sensible to execute a declaration of trust and to have the declaration of trust adjudicated as not chargeable to duty. The fee for this is HK$20. Adjudication can avoid later disputes with the Stamp Duty Office about the beneficial ownership of shares.</p>
								<p>Penalties for failure to stamp documents within the required time range from two to ten times the amount of duty payable, although the Collector of Stamp Revenue has power to remit the whole or any part of any penalty in appropriate cases. Neither the company nor any other person is permitted to act on or in general rely in court proceedings on any stampable instrument which is not duly stamped. An unstamped instrument may not be registered in the company’s books.</p>
								<p>After stamping (and compliance with any other formalities prescribed by the articles of association), the transfer can be registered in the statutory books of the company and a new share certificate issued.</p>
								<p>Share transfers are sometimes restricted by, for example, provisions in the company’s articles of association which require that the shares are first offered for sale to existing shareholders.</p>

									<p>&nbsp;The Inland Revenue Ordinance does not requires the corporation’s accounts to be audited. Rather, it is the Companies Ordinance that makes the requirement. So, if the corporation is registered in a country without audit requirement, the IRD&nbsp;may accept unaudited accounts providing they are certified by the directors. Besides, a Hong Kong limited company may be exempt from audit under the Companies Ordinance such as&nbsp;a dormant company, the IRD&nbsp;will also accept unaudited accounts.</p>

								<h3>Deadline and Extension for Filing of Profits Tax Return</h3>
								<p>There are two types of issue of profits tax returns:</p>
								<p>the odd issue. The odd issue of tax returns is on a case by case basis throughout the year of assessment at the discretion of the assessing officer. The time limit to file a tax return is usually set at one month from the date of issue save the urgent cases, for example a sole trader has ceased his business and is going to leave Hong Kong permanently, in which the time limit may be less than one month.</p>
								<p>the bulk issue. The bulk issue of tax returns is done by the computer in April to a lot of taxpayers according to their accounting dates. Although the time limit for filing the tax returns on bulk issue is also set at one month from the issue date, the taxpayer can ask for an extension of the time limit if his accounting date falls in the categories “M” and “D”.</p>
								<p>The extension applies to the current year of assessment only. Automatic extension is granted to those taxpayers who are represented by a tax representative. Unrepresented taxpayers will be granted the extension upon written request. The exact dates and details of the extension may differ slightly from year to year and they are published on the <a href="http://www.ird.gov.hk/" target="_blank">IRD’s website</a>. Although in general no further extension will be granted beyond the above time limits, the assessor may extend the time limit in special cases where the taxpayer has pressing problems in meeting the deadline.</p>

								<blockquote>
									<p>Where a private company only has one shareholder and that shareholder takes a decision that may be taken in a shareholders’ meeting, the decision shall be evidenced by a written resolution or a written record of the decision which must be delivered to the company within 7 days of the decision having been made.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<h3>Directors and Board Meetings</h3>
								<p>For a typical Private Limited Company, the director board authorizes the actions of the company through board resolutions passed at board meetings or, if authorized by the articles, by written resolution signed by all the directors or a stated proportion of them.</p>
								<p>There is no physical location and time interval requirement that board meetings be held in Hong Kong or at any specific intervals. Normally, reasonable notice of meetings must be given to each director, but the Articles of Association can modify this general obligation. The board of directors may delegate its powers to certain persons. A certain degree of delegation is, so far as third parties dealing with the company are concerned, normally implied in the case of managing directors and senior employees of a company.</p>
								<h3>Shareholders and Shareholder Meetings</h3>
								<p>Certain decisions however must, by law, be made or sanctioned by the shareholders in general meeting. This is done by the passing of an ordinary or, in some cases, a special resolution. Such resolutions may be proposed as special business at annual general meetings or at separately convened meetings, called extraordinary general meetings.</p>
								<p>An ordinary resolution requires a simple majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a meeting to approve it. A special resolution , on the other hand, requires a 75% majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a meeting to approve it.</p>
								<p>Generally, 14 clear days’ notice is required for a meeting at which an ordinary resolution is proposed and 21 clear days’ notice is required for a meeting at which a special resolution is proposed or for the holding of an annual general meeting. A majority in number of shareholders having the right to attend and vote at general meetings who together hold not less than 95% in nominal value of all the shares, or all the shareholders in the case of an annual general meeting, may agree that a meeting be held at short notice.</p>
								<p>The Articles of Association should make provision for the quorum and voting rights and will determine whether or not the chairman of the meeting has a casting vote. There is a statutory right on the part of a shareholder to appoint a proxy to attend and vote on his or her behalf at any meeting at which the shareholder is entitled to attend and vote. A statement to this effect must be included in the notice of each general meeting. A proxy need not be a member and will have the same right to speak at the meeting as his or her appointor. A corporation which is a member can attend a meeting by appointing a representative to attend the meeting on its behalf. Such a representative can speak and vote on a show of hands or on a poll. A proxy’s rights to vote are limited to voting on a poll unless the Articles provide otherwise. It is usually necessary to lodge appointments of proxies (but not of corporate representatives) in advance of the meeting.</p>
								<p>A Hong Kong company’s Articles of Association will usually permit resolutions to be passed by a written resolution signed by all the shareholders, without the need to hold a meeting, however notice of written resolutions must be provided to the auditors at or before the time of submission to members for signature. (Every company must hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting each year. This may not be done by written resolution.)</p>

								<h3>Book-keeping Requirements</h3>
								<p>Proper books of account&nbsp;are necessary to give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs and to explain its transactions with respected to the following:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>all sums of money received and expended by the company and the matters in respect of which the receipt and expenditure takes place;</li>

								<h3>Introduction&nbsp;of Audited Financial Statements</h3>
								<p><strong>Statutory reports</strong> are required annually for companies incorporated in Hong Kong. The reports must contain <strong>audited financial statements</strong> for the current year, with corresponding amounts for the preceding year, including a <strong>balance sheet</strong>, <strong>profit and loss account</strong>, and a <strong>cash flow statement</strong>. Audited financial statements must be signed off by a <strong>Certified Public Accountant (CPA)</strong>.</p>
								<p>Audited financial statements is a reporting tool for the financial accountability of a business entities providing to investors, board members, and constituents.</p>
								<p>The source documents for the audited financial statements are usually provided by the organization wishing to have an auditor prepare for a financial statement. This will often include a wide range of financial documents including&nbsp;information of Accounts Payable and Receivable, expense reports, budgets plan, and any other material related to the finance of a company. The aim of the accountant is to analyze, evaluate and cross-reference these various financial statements in order to provide a an audited financial statement that the organization can then present to interested parties.</p>
								<p>Audited financial statements are often prepared on an <strong>annual basis</strong>, and are presented to persons or groups who have an ongoing interest in the organization. For businesses, the audited financial statements are often made available to investors (shareholders), upper level management, and the Board of Directors.</p>
								<h3>Financial Reports Used to Prepare Audited Financial Statements</h3>
								<p>The company needs to provide their income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows along with financial documentation to support CPA for audit as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Income statement = the P&amp;L (Profit and Loss) and Statement of Operations.</strong> The income statement demonstrates how revenue earned (the top line) from the sales of products and services before expenses are taken out is transformed into the net income (bottom line), the end result after revenue and expenses are accounted for. The income statement documents whether the company made a profit or not during a reported period of time.</li>
									<li><strong>Balance sheet =&nbsp;statement of financial position.</strong> It is a summary of a company’s balances as of a specific date, usually the last day of the fiscal year. The balance sheet is composed of three parts: assets, liabilities, and ownership equity or net worth, with assets in one section and liabilities and net worth in the other, with the two sections balancing. The difference between assets and liabilities is a company’s net worth or equity. A company’s assets also equal their liabilities plus owner’s equity, which will show how the assets were financed, either by borrowing money (liability) or using the owner’s money (owner equity).</li>
									<li><strong>The statement of cash flows.</strong>&nbsp;It&nbsp;shows how changes in the balance sheet and income statement affect cash and cash equivalents. It also demonstrates operating, investing, and financing activities. The statement of cash flows helps investors and management determine the short-term viability of a company, specifically their ability to cover expenses.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h3>Auditor’s opinion to an Audited Financial Statements</h3>
								<p>The CPA examines these three financial statements and their supporting documentation provided by the company and assesses the overall accounting principles used. From this information the CPA creates an audited financial statement which will include an opinion, either qualified or unqualified, about the nature of the financial documents.&nbsp;Audited financial statements usually include a section&nbsp;that is referred to as an opinion. It is the responsibility of the accountant to provide opinion on the audited statements:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>an unqualified opinion&nbsp;(A “clean” opinion,&nbsp;auditor is in agreement with the methods used by the company to prepared for those submitted documents and thus this Statements is accurate and complete)</strong>, or;</li>
									<li><strong>a qualified opinion (opposite of qualified opinion, auditor is NOT in agreement to)</strong>, or;</li>
									<li><strong>an adverse opinion (auditor gives major exception or warning)</strong>, or</li>
									<li><strong>disclaimer of &nbsp;opinion (auditor refuses to give opinion, commonly known as”no opinion”)</strong>.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Reason of rendering a Qualified Opinion or “No-Opinion”</h3>
								<p>The auditor is not in agreement with the methods used to prepare the supporting financial documents. This does not necessarily mean that the accountant thinks unethical question is found. However, it could mean that the auditor&nbsp;found instances where expenses should have been assigned to a different category, or there were technical&nbsp;errors found in line items.</p>
								<p>For “no-opinon”,&nbsp;the auditor may mean that the supplied accounting records were insufficient to prepare for&nbsp;audited financial statements, or that there were a number of issues that must&nbsp;be addressed before the auditor would evaluate the accuracy of the information provided.</p>
								<p>Generally, when an accountant declines to issue an opinion, there is a need for an organization to retool their internal accounting procedures, so they can operate according to the usual and proper accounting standards.</p>

								<h3>Definition of Dormant Company</h3>
								<p>“Dormant” is legal term that applies to Hong Kong private companies limited by shares. The company must&nbsp;have “no significant accounting transactions” during a financial year so that no entries in the company’s accounting records.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>The costs incurred for&nbsp;the company to keep its incorporation statue&nbsp;do NOT count as significant accounting transactions.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<h3>Reasons for application for Dormant Status</h3>
								<p>It is a voluntary action of companies owners to apply for dormant status to their company, so there are numerous reasons to do so. Since a company can remain in “Dormant” as long as necessary, it is a perfect solution to hold its registered business name, asset, and intellectual property for protection from being registered by others.</p>
								<p>The other common reasons are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Awaiting for future development</li>
									<li>No plan in doing business in the coming year</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>The members’&nbsp;duties&nbsp;of a Dormant Company</h3>
								<p>The Director(s) and Company Secretary are still responsible for handling and pay for the Annual Return, Tax Return, and Business Registration renewal on time. Meanwhile, they must&nbsp;report any changes in its registration &nbsp;to the CR.</p>
								<h3>Advantage of making your Company in Dormant Status</h3>
								<p>As the company must have “no significant accounting transactions” during its dormant status,&nbsp;the cost of “maintaining the company” (e.g. effort in accounting and auditing) can be significantly reduced without having to wind up or apply and to de-register the company.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>It is necessary for a dormant company to prepare audited accounts before completing the Profits Tax Return as required.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<h3>Application procedures for Dormant Status</h3>
								<p>A company will be eligible to apply for dormant status if it can fulfill all the conditions of the following:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Since the date of incorporation or any other specified date, it has not entered into what is known as a “relevant accounting transaction”, which is a transaction &nbsp;to be entered into the company’s books of account including the receipt and expenditure of money and the sale and purchase of goods, assets and liabilities, but not including a fee which a company is required to pay by law, for example the annual business registration fee.</li>
									<li>Prior to a company ceasing to be dormant, the directors must deliver to the CR&nbsp;a further statutory declaration that the company intends to enter into a relevant accounting transaction, at which stage the company will cease to be dormant and the normal requirements will apply again.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The company must pass a <strong>special resolution</strong> authorizing its directors to deliver to the Companies Registry. After CR approval, a statutory declaration to the effect that the company will be treated as a dormant company.</p>
								<h3>Cessation of Dormant Status</h3>
								<p>It is possible to cease anytime&nbsp;the dormant status by advising the CR&nbsp;with filled statutory declaration.</p>

								<blockquote>
									<p>Companies can be closed down either by “De-registration” or “Winding Up”. Although both the procedures will result in the dissolution of a company, the processes they entail are <strong>significantly different</strong>.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<h3>What is&nbsp;Deregistration / Striking Off?</h3>
								<p>Deregistration / Striking Off is a company’s voluntary application to its authorities of incorporation (in Hong Kong, Companies Registry is responsible authority) for&nbsp;cessation of its legal status &nbsp;and thus doing business, and this application is irreversible. Since these government departments usually take time to process the application, a&nbsp;company is still required to file various&nbsp;returns before it is officially deregistered, or penalty will be imposed for late submission and may turn down the application.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>The application requires various&nbsp;declarations be made by the applicant. Any person who knowingly and recklessly gives false or misleading information to the CR&nbsp;is liable to a fine and to imprisonment.</p>
									<p>Before the application begin, it is important that all the liabilities of the company must be settled and all assets disposed/processed. In particular, any balance in the bank account of the company should be transferred out.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>A company is highly recommended to seek professional consultation in the earliest stage&nbsp;of application since the deregistration process is more technical and affecting company’s property.</p>
								<h3>Is my company eligible for&nbsp;Deregistration?</h3>
								<p>First of all, your company must be a Hong Kong-incorporated private company and is defunct solvent.</p>
								<p>Secondly, the application must be handled by the company itself,&nbsp;a director or a member of this that company.</p>
								<p>Then, the company must fulfill all of the conditions as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>all the members agree to the deregistration;</li>
									<li>no outstanding liabilities (including government penalty);</li>
									<li>Either; (a) the company has never commenced business or operation, or (b) has stopped operation for business for more than three months prior to the application of deregistration;</li>
								</ul>
								<p>For some categories of companies that are regulated by others ordinance, deregistration is not a mean to cease their business. The categories are as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>an authorized banking or financing institution by Banking Ordinance</li>
									<li>an insurance firm as insurer by Insurance Companies Ordinance</li>
									<li>a broker company by Securities and Futures Ordinance</li>
									<li>a company having a subsidiary that falls within any of the above categories, and</li>
									<li>a company that has fallen within any of the above categories at any time in the preceding five years</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Request for a Notice of No Objection (NNO):</h3>

								<p>Winding-up is also sometimes referred to as liquidation. To purpose of company winding-up is to ensure that all the company’s affairs have been dealt with properly and to have the company dissolved.</p>
								<p>Winding-up may either be compulsory or voluntary: based on the initiator of this action, we can classify the winding-up into the following:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Members’ Voluntary Winding-up</li>
									<li>Creditors’ Voluntary Winding-up</li>
									<li>Compulsory Winding-up by the court (The High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>For voluntary winding-up (a company winding-up by the company itself), no matter if&nbsp;the company is in financial difficulty or not, it may hold a general meeting of its shareholders to bring itself to an end by winding-up procedures. If a special resolution is passed for winding-up, the company may then apply to the Court for a winding-up order (via procedures similar to a creditor’s petition).</p>
								<p>Alternatively, a special resolution that the company be wound up voluntarily may be passed. In that case, no winding-up order from the Court is necessary.</p>
								<h3>What are the effects of voluntary winding-up?</h3>
								<p>Upon the commencement of the voluntary winding-up, the company will cease to carry on business except that which may be required for the benefit of winding- up smoothly. The legal status and powers of the company will continue until it is dissolved.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, any transfer of shares (except a transfer made by the liquidator or made with his/her approval), and any alteration to the status of the members of the company which is made after the commencement of a voluntary winding-up, will be void.</p>
								<p>When the directors believe that the company will be able to pay its full debts within 12 months after the commencement of the winding-up, the members can carry out members’ voluntary winding-up.</p>
								<p>For example, your company is in heavy debt and will not be able to continue business or pay off the debts you may consider the option of voluntary winding-up.</p>
								<h3>Relevant procedures of Voluntary Winding-up</h3>

									</li>
									<li>The company has to actively call a meeting of all creditors. The notice for the meeting has to be advertised in the Government Gazette and in at least a Chinese and a English local newspapers.</li>
