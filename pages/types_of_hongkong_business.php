								<p>“Limited Partnership” is regulated and formed under Limited Partnership Ordinance and requires the registration in Companies Registry. By default, all partnership is General Partnership unless it can complete its registration and comply with its ongoing requirement to become a Limited Partnership.</p>
								<p>We can treat the Limited Partnership as “feature-upgraded extension” of General Partnership by introducing a new type of partner named “<strong>Limited Partner</strong>” while another type is “<strong>General Partner</strong>”.</p>
								<p>Unless a Partnership Agreement has stated extra clarification, Limited Partner are only liable for the capital they contributed to the firm provided that they do not have management power to the business firm. Therefore, Limited Partners do not involve in the ordinary business matters, do not have power to dissolve the firm, and &nbsp;need not be consented on introduction of new partners. Nevertheless, they are able to determine their partnership interest.</p>
								<p>Limited Partnership provides an additional <b>upgrade path</b> to existing General Partnership for investors who want to contribute their capital to the firm but do not want to take part in management and hope to limited their liable to the amount of invested capital.</p>

								<p>Representative Office is the common name but someone may refer this business vehicle as “Liaison Office”, we believe they are refer the same type of business vehicle. This “vehicle” can only accept oversea companies (the companies incorporated outside Hong Kong) to register for them to establish “a place of business” in Hong Kong as “an extension from its oversea owner to Hong Kong” and using the identical name as its oversea company. Since it is not a separate legal entity in Hong Kong from its oversea owner, so its registration is NOT handled by Companies Registry. Representative office / Liaison office registration is handled by only Business Registration Office under Inland Revenue Department.</p>
								<p>Unlike all business entities in Hong Kong, <strong>Representative Office is NOT allowed to engage in any activity obtaining money from any source other than its parent company, thus Representative Office is impossible to make profit in Hong Kong.</strong> Legally, representative office is not an incorporated body. The liability incurred during operation of Representative Office is unlimited liable to the oversea parent company. It is also required that <strong>a local registered address</strong> must be provided to fulfill the legal requirement. The business owner can hire staffs using the name of Representative Office.</p>
								<p>Every Representative office must have one local representative to represent the office for government’s record and serving as a local contact to this Representative Office. The business owner can appoint either one type of following to take this position (More than 1 representative can be appointed for a Representative Office in Hong Kong):</p>
								<ul>
									<li>a natural person resident in Hong Kong</li>
									<li>a firm of solicitor or a solicitor corporation in Hong Kong</li>
									<li>a firm of a corporate practice of certified public accountants (practicing)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Here is a summary of Representative Office in Hong Kong.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Representative Office cannot conclude activities intended to make profit because they cannot obtain other source of money except its parent company.</li>
									<li>Only oversea company is able to register a Representative Office.</li>
									<li>Representative Office must register its name the same as its owner (the oversea company)</li>
									<li>Representative office is not an incorporated body thus it is not classified as company and need not fulfilling the compliance requirement same as company, although its registration is processed by companies registry.</li>
									<li>Its composition requires one local representative, it is only seem as a contact person in view of government.</li>
									<li>A local registered address is required for its composition.</li>
									<li>Hiring staff by the own name of Representative Office is allowed for building local workforce.</li>
									<li>Although it is unable generate profit, it is still required to finish and submit the annual tax return.</li>

								<p>Incorporation of a company in Hong Kong is regulated by <a href="http://www.cr.gov.hk/en/home/index.htm" target="_blank">Companies Registry</a> under the law Companies.</p>
								<p>In Hong Kong, we can classify companies into to 2 types regarding to what the companies’ are limited by – <strong>Company Limited by Guarantee</strong> and <strong>Company Limited by Share</strong>, over 99% of registered limited companies are limited by shares, while the remaining are limited by guarantee which is a specific form of business entities for doing non-profit and charity works.</p>
								<p>In the category of Limited Company by Shares, they are group in 2 types regarding to level of confidence to their financial situation – <strong>Private Limited Company</strong> and <strong>Public Limited Company</strong>. Private Limited Company does not required to disclose its financial statue to the public, and has restriction of its number of investors, so it is the most popular business entity for small-to-medium size business.</p>
								<p>Among the Public Limited Company, some of them are also list on Hong Kong Stock Exchange, these company is named <strong>Listed Company</strong>.</p>
								<p>Finally, a minority of Hong Kong company is registered as <strong>non-Hong Kong company</strong>, it’s a type of legal entity for a oversea/foreign company to setup and own a Hong Kong company without separated legal entity to its oversea/foreign owning company. <strong>The non-Hong Kong company is held unlimited liable by its owner</strong>.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>We usually called a “Company limited by Shares” as “Company Limited (Co. Ltd.)” and even “Limited (Ltd.)”in short-term because this type of company is the dominant in number and popularity.</p>
									<p>A company named as “Limited” may theoretically refer to any kind of “Limited Company” (i.e. by Shares or by Guarantee) . However, we always understood that “Limited” is referring to Limited Company by Shares because of it majority in Hong Kong, and this company may be either Private Company or Public Company. The company are not required to include the word “private” of “public” in their company names in Hong Kong.</p>

								<p>Speaking of owners’ liability of Sole Proprietorship and Partnership, we can easily understand the owner(s) of these business entities are people – a natural born people – and their firms are binded to them personally. Legally, the firm and the owner are not the separate legal body thus the owners are liable to unlimited personal liability to their firm.</p>
								<p>While a natural person obtains it personhood when he is born, a company does so when it is incorporated according to certain company laws (i.e. Company Ordinance in Hong Kong). Precisely speaking, a company is a fictitious person who is treated by law as if they were a natural person, we call this artificial form of legal entity as <strong>Legal Person</strong>.</p>
								<p>Unlike other business form, the major difference between Limited Company) &nbsp;and Sole Proprietorship or Partnership is <strong>how the ownership of a company is distributed among owners</strong>:</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>People or organization can acquire the ownership of a company by acquiring “shares” which is issued by this company and holding the “shares” to express his owner’s rights and duties in the company.</p>
								</blockquote>
								<p>The owners of “shares” is named as “Shareholders”, and the action of holding the shares is “shareholding”. “Shareholders” is the owner of a company because of injection of capital. A shareholder can precisely expresses his portion of ownership in a company – degree of ownership is proportional to his&nbsp;ratio&nbsp;of shareholding&nbsp;among all of the shareholders. Since a company is a separate legal person to the shareholders, the loss incurred by the company is limited to the Shareholders’ investment and do not liable to them personally. As returns, Shareholders can shares the company’s profit by receiving “dividend” per shares.</p>
								<p>In the contrast, Company has legal personality, it means a company is capable of having legals rights and duties within a legal system, for example, a company is able to enter into contracts, sue and be sued. The law treats a company as a natural person. &nbsp;Therefore, position of shareholder of a company can be acted by either natural person or legal person, the investors can diversify their risk by simply acquiring shares of a company which is shareholding a variety of companies.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>To conclude, Limited Company is a man-made entity to&nbsp;encourages&nbsp;the investors to joint their effort together and own an separate legal entity for venturing in the aim of profits; while their liability to loss are limited to their investment and profit are shared in proportion to each investor’s investment.</p>

								<blockquote>
									<p>Effective on 3 March 2014, every Private Limited Company must have at least one director who is natural person according to the amendment of Company Ordinance for enhanced transparency and accountability of directors.</p>
									<p>&nbsp;</p>
									<p>When a Limited Company is formed it must issue one or more subscriber shares (e.g. total no of shares created on paper) to its initial members (e.g. structure of shareholding), and nominate the value of each share (e.g. nominal value of each share). Therefore,<strong>Share Capital</strong> of the company is the total number of shares existing in the company multiplied by the nominal value of each share. In Hong Kong, these initial shareholders need not&nbsp;pay for their subscribed shares at the time of formation, all value are only on-paper.</p>

								<p>Hong Kong is one of the best cities for doing business, when foreign companies (which is those companies incorporated outside Hong Kong) are prepared to establish a place of doing business here, the investors can choose either setting up a Representative Office, incorporation of a Private Company limited by Shares (a.k.a Limited Company) and/or Non-Hong Kong Company under the Hong Kong Company Ordinance.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<h4>Do you know?</h4>
									<p>We sometimes hear the name “subsidiary” and “branch office” from foreign investors in Hong Kong. Although literally these two names mean a place of doing business which are an extension of their parent companies, they have different legal definition in Hong Kong:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>“Subsidiary” is NOT a legal business entity in Hong Kong, it is no way to set up a “subsidiary office” in the Hong Kong Companies Registry (CR);</li>
										<li>“Branch” (a.k.a Branch Office) has a specific meaning in Hong Kong: it is NOT a legal entity registered in CR, this is merely an extension of its parent business which must be incorporated / registered in Hong Kong. Branch office is not treated as a separate legal entity from its parent company, it does not has its own right so that the parent company is responsible for all the debts and liabilities of it.</li>
										<li>The registration of Branch is solely handled by Business Registration Officer (BRO) under Inland Revenue Department.</li>
										<li>For example, a local company which is a registered fashion retailing business opens a few chain stores sharing the same brand name and centrally managed by this company in Hong Kong. Each store must be registered as a “Branch” in BRO under the single parent company in order to doing business in each store.</li>
										<li>The advantage of registering each store as a branch over that of a company is that the parent company is responsible to handle all tax filing as well as annual return of all the branch thus lowering the accounting and auditing expense and enhancing central manageability.</li>
									</ul>
								</blockquote>
								<p>The “Non-Hong Kong Company” is a form of incorporated body exclusive to the oversea companies (incorporated outside Hong Kong) to <strong>solely owning a company in Hong Kong for engaging in intended profit-making business without separate source of fund, name, as well as liability from its oversea company</strong>.</p>
								<p>Alike the private company in Hong Kong, it has the requirement on company secretary and registered address. However, the owner (a oversea company) must submit its published account books, Certificate of Incorporation and any other information required for annual return and tax return in its jurisdiction of incorporation to Hong Kong Companies Registry on the registration of a “non-Hong Kong Company”. After registration, these document are required for submitting annual return and tax return.</p>
