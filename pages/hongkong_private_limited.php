										<li>The use of specific words and expression in company names is regulated by other laws, using them is prohibited unless certain approval, e.g. “Bank”, “Stock Exchange”, “Certified Public Accountant”/“CPA”, “trust”, “chamber of commerce”.</li>
										<li>Some of the common words are widely considered as “the same as”, here are some of the well-known examples:
											<ul>
												<li>The definite article, e.g. The Chris Smith Consulting Limited is the same as Chris Smith Consulting Limited.</li>
												<li>The short form, e.g. “Hong Kong”, “Hongkong” and “HK” are the same.</li>
												<li>The symbol, e.g, “&amp;” and “and” are the same.</li>
												<li>The combination by “-”, e.g. combine 2 words with or without “-” are the same, so “Multi-trade”, “Multitrade” and “Multi Trade” are the same.</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Sometimes, CR will reject a proposed name because the name is “too like” of an existing live record.</li>
										<li>Regarding to the protection of intellectual property, you are advised to search your proposed name in the <a href="http://ipsearch.ipd.gov.hk/" target="_blank">Hong Kong Trademark Register</a> after the company name search to reduce the risk of infringement of trademarks.

								<p>Every company which is limited by shares must state its share capital and initial shareholding structure among its initial shareholders (we call the initial shareholders as Founder Members). To describe the structure of shareholdings, the founders has to “create” the total number of shares and the value of each share that are owned by a company initially, and “transfer” the specific portion of total shares to each founder member according to specific member’s degree of ownership. The shares are “created” and “transferred” because none of the real money transaction is involved. In other words, these action are done on the paper.</p>
								<p>In nutshell, the “created” Share Capital on paper is “Authorized Shares Capital” while the “transfered” Share Capital on paper is “Issued Capital”.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p><strong>Information Required</strong></p>
									<p>To fulfill the requirement on incorporation in Hong Kong, the founder members must correctly state the following:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Class of Shares (eg. Ordinary, Preference, etc)</li>
										<li>Total number of shares proposed to be issued</li>
										<li>Currency</li>
										<li>Total amount of share capital to be subscribed by all of the founder members</li>

										<li>Total amount to Remain Unpaid or to be Regarded as Unpaid on the Shares Proposed to be Issued</li>

								<p>The company can issued extra shares after its incorporation for changing of shareholding structure, so it is not necessary to hold extra authorized share during capital incorporation.</p>
								<p>If the company issues <strong>more than one class of shares</strong> on incorporation, the rights of each class MUST be clearly stated on Particulars of Rights Attached to Shares, including whether shares are redeemable, voting rights, rights to receive dividends, rights to receive capital, etc.</p>
